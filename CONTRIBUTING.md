# Contributing

Contributions are more than welcome. Bug reports with specific reproduction steps are great. If you have a code contribution you'd like to make, open a pull request with suggested code.

Note that PR's and issues are reviewed every ~2 weeks. If your PR or issue is critical in nature, please reflect that in the description so that it receives faster attention.

Pull requests should:
- Clearly state their intent in the title
- Have a description that explains the need for the changes
- Include tests! (Make sure the scripts complete in your test environment)
- Not break the public API
- Add yourself to the CONTRIBUTING file
