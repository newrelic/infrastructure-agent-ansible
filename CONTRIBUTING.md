# Contributing

Contributions are more than welcome. Bug reports with specific reproduction steps are great. If you have a code contribution you'd like to make, open a pull request with suggested code.

Pull requests should:

- Clearly state their intent in the title
- Have a description that explains the need for the changes
- Include tests! (Make sure the scripts complete in your test environment)
- Not break the public API
- Add yourself to the CONTRIBUTING file
