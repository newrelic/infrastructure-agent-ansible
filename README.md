# Ansible role for the New Relic infrastructure agent ![test_ansible](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent-ansible/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=master) ![release_ansible](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent-ansible/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)

An Ansible role that can be used to install and/or configure the New Relic
Infrastructure Agent and install New Relic Infrastructure OHIs.

## Getting Started

To use the `newrelic.newrelic-infra` role directly in a playbook, simply
[include the role in your playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html#using-roles). For example,

```yaml
# myplaybook.yml
---
- hosts: webservers
  roles:
    - role: newrelic.newrelic-infra
      vars:
        nrinfragent_config:
          license_key: 12345
```

To require `newrelic.newrelic-infra` as a role depencency your own role,
[add a dependency in the meta/main.yml of your role](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html#using-role-dependencies). For example,

```yaml
# roles/myapp/meta/main.yml
---
dependencies:
  - role: newrelic.newrelic-infra
```

## Usage

This role can be used for the following interactions with the New Relic
Infrastructure Agent.

* Install the agent via OS package manager
* Install the agent via tarball (Linux only)
* Install integrations via OS package manager
* Configure the agent
* Setup the agent init service

By default, the role will install the agent via the OS package maanger,
install any integrations via the OS package manager, configure the agent, and
setup the agent init service. Additionally, the following tags are available to
perform other interactions.

* nria_install
* nria_install_tarball
* nria_install_integrations
* nria_configure
* nria_setup_service

### Basic Usage

The following snippet will install the agent via the OS package manager,
configure the agent with the specified configuration and setup the agent OS
init service.

```yaml
---
- hosts: ap_ne_1
  roles:
    - name: newrelic.newrelic-infra
      vars:
        log_file: /opt/logs/newrelic-infra.log
        verbose: 0
        nrinfragent_config:
          license_key: 12345
        custom_attributes:
          environment: dev
```

### Tarball Installation (Linux Only)

To install using the [tarball installation method](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/tarball-assisted-install-infrastructure-agent-linux/
), you must set the `nrinfragent_tarball_version` variable to a valid
[tarball version number](https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/binaries/linux/).
Installation via the tarball installation method will also run the configuration
and agent OS init service tasks unless the `nria_install_tarball` tag is
specified.

```yaml
- hosts: ap_ne_1
  roles:
    - name: newrelic.newrelic-infra
      vars:
        nrinfragent_tarball_version: 1.18.0
        nrinfragent_config:
          log_file: /opt/logs/newrelic-infra.log
          verbose: 0
          license_key: 12345
          custom_attributes:
            environment: dev
```

### Configure Only

The following snippet will only configure the agent configuration of an existing
installation as long as the playbook is run with `--tags nria_configure`. Note
that the [`include_role`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html#including-roles-dynamic-reuse) must be used in this case.

```yaml
- hosts: ap_ne_1
  tasks:
  - name: configure the New Relic Infrastructure Agent
    include_role:
      name: newrelic.newrelic-infra
    vars:
      nrinfragent_config:
        license_key: 12345
        log_file: /opt/logs/newrelic-infra.log
        verbose: 0
        custom_attributes:
          environment: dev
    tags:
    - nria_configure
```

## Reference

### Role configuration

#### Variables

The role configuration variables are documented [inline](./defaults/main.yml)
as well as below.

##### `nrinfragent_state` (Optional)

Install or uninstall packages (package manager installation). Package manager
installations are performed using the
[Ansible package module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/package_module.html).

* `'latest'` - [default] install the latest version of the agent. Also `present`.
* `'absent'` - Uninstall the agent.

##### `nrinfragent_service_state` (Optional)

Specifies the state of the `newrelic-infra` service after install.  Defaults to
`started`, which ensures the service will be running. Change it to `stopped` to
install only, without starting it right away. See additional information about
valid values in the
[Ansible service module documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/service_module.html#parameter-enabled).

##### `nrinfragent_service_enabled` (Optional)

Specifies if the service will start during boot. Defauts to `yes`. change it to
`no` to prevent the service from starting automatically on boot. See additional information about
valid values in the
[Ansible service module documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/service_module.html#parameter-state).

##### `nrinfragent_config_file` (Optional)

Specifies a custom path on the to the New Relic Infrastructure Agent
[configuration file](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/configuration/configure-infrastructure-agent/) on the target
hosts.  Defaults to `/etc/newrelic-infra.yml` on Linux and
`%ProgramFiles%\New Relic\newrelic-infra\newrelic-infra.yml` on Windows. This
can be especially useful on [Linux tarball installs](#tarball-installation-linux-only)
when installing to non-default locations.

##### `nrinfragent_config` (Required)

Used to populate the agent configuration. At a minimum you must provide
`license_key`. For current configuration options, see the
[New Relic documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/configure-infrastructure-agent). For example:

```yml
custom_attributes:
  business_unit: sales
  team: newrelic
license_key: D000000000000000000000000000000000000000
log_file: /tmp/logs.log
verbose: 1
```

##### `nrinfragent_integrations` (Optional)

Specifies the On-Host Integrations to be installed via the OS package manager.
The list of available integrations can be found [here][1].

Each package should provide its `name` and `state`. The integrations package
name is located in the **Install and activate** section of the
[individual integrations docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations). As
a convention, their name is the name of the service with the `nri-` prefix
(`nri-apache`, `nri-redis`, etc.).

By default the state it's `absent`, which doesn't install the package; you can
change it to `latest` or `present`. For example:

```yml
nrinfragent_integrations:
  - name: nri-nginx
    state: latest
  - name: nri-mysql
    state: absent
```

The source code for each integration is available on [newrelic's GitHub organization][2].

##### license_key (DEPRECATED)

You can specify the license key via the top level `license_key` for backward
compatibility. We recommend that you use `license_key` in `nrinfragent_config`
instead. If both are specified, the one in `nrinfragent_config` takes
precedence.

##### nrinfragent_tarball_version (Required for Tarball Installation Only)

Specifies the New Relic Infrastructure agent tarball version to download.
[Linux only](https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/binaries/linux/).

#### Removing the `newrelic-infra-integrations` package and its bundled integrations

> This only applies if you have the `newrelic-infra-integrations` package
> installed

If you want to remove the `newrelic-infra-integrations` package or any of the
bundled integrations (nri-redis, nri-cassandra, nri-apache, nri-nginx,
nri-mysql), add `newrelic-infra-integrations` as the first item of
`nrinfragent_integrations` with the state `absent`.

```yml
nrinfragent_integrations:
  - name: newrelic-infra-integrations
    state: "absent"
```

## Testing

The `infrastructure-agent-ansible` role uses [molecule](https://github.com/ansible-community/molecule)
for testing. Three scenarios are provided.

1. The [default](./molecule/default) scenario tests installation and
   configuration of the agent and setup of OS init services all via the OS
   package manager.
1. The [configure](./molecule/configure) scenario tests running configuration
   of the agent only using the `nria_conigure` tag. Note that in order to run
   this test, the `default` scenario's `create` and `converge` method should be
   run first so the `configure` scenario has an installed agent to test with.
1. The [targz](./molecule/targz) scenario tests installation and
   configuration of the agent and setup of OS init services using the tarball
   installation method.

The `default` and `targz` scenarios can be run in full using `molecule test`.
Note that the `test` command will destroy the containers after testing and
verifying the scenario.  Therefore, the best way to run the `configure` scenario
is to use `molecule converge && molecule test -s configure && molecule destroy`.

## Release to Ansible Galaxy

To release a new version to [Ansible Galaxy][3] follow this steps:

* Update the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
* Create a new GitHub release.
* Make sure the version is imported into [Ansible Galaxy][3], if there is any
  issue, ask one of the project owners.
