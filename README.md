## Reference

### Role Configuration

#### Variables

##### `nrinfragent_state` (OPTIONAL)

Describes what you want to do with the agent:

* `'latest'` - [default] install the latest version of the agent. Also `present`.
* `'absent'` - Uninstall the agent.

##### `nrinfragent_os_name` (OPTIONAL)

Specifies the target OS that the Infrastructure agent will be installed on.
Defaults to `ansible_os_family`. See list in the `meta/main.yml` file for latest list that is supported.

##### `nrinfragent_os_version` (OPTIONAL)

Specifies the OS version of the installer package needed for this machine.
Defaults to `ansible_lsb.major_release`. Mostly used for `RedHat` family OSs. See list in the `meta/main.yml` file for latest list.

##### `nrinfragent_os_codename` (OPTIONAL)

Specifies the OS codename of the installer package needed for this machine.
Defaults to `ansible_lsb.codename`. Mostly used for `Debian` family OSs. See list in the `meta/main.yml` file for latest list.

##### `nrinfragent_config` (REQUIRED)

Used to populate agent configuration. At a minimum you must provide `license_key`.
See the NewRelic documentation for current configuration options:
[https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/configure-infrastructure-agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/configure-infrastructure-agent)

##### `nrinfragent_choco_version` (OPTIONAL)
Specifies the version of newrelice infra chocolatey package to install on Windows. Can be used to pin the version or upgrade the agent.

##### `nrinfragent_service_state` (OPTIONAL)
Specifies the state of the newrelic-infra service after installation.
Defaults to `started` which ensures the service will be running. You can change it to `stopped` to just install it but don't start it in this moment.

##### `nrinfragent_service_enabled` (OPTIONAL)
Specifies if the service will be enabled (start during boot).
Defauts to `yes`, you can change it to `no` to prevent the service to automatically start on boot.

##### `nrinfragent_integrations` (OPTIONAL)

Specifies the infrastructure integrations to be installed. The list of available
integrations can be found [here][1].

Each package sould provide the `name` and `state`. The integrations package name is located
in the **Install and activate** section of the individual integrations docs. They use the
following convention: name of the service with the `nri-` prefix (`nri-apache`, `nri-redis`, ...).
By default the state it's `absent`, which doesn't install the package; you can change it to
`latest` or `present`.

configuration e.g.

```
nrinfragent_integrations:
  - { name: nri-nginx, state: "latest" }
  - { name: nri-mysql, state: "absent" }
```

The source code for each integration is available on [newrelic's github organization][2].

#### Removing newrelic-infra-integrations package and its bundled integrations

**NOTE** *This only applies if you have the `newrelic-infra-integrations`
package installed*

If you had installed the `newrelic-infra-integrations` package,
could be because you were using the previous versions of this module, or you
installed it some other way; and you want to do some cleanup by
removing it or any of the following integrations (the ones that came bundle
with it):

- nri-redis
- nri-cassandra
- nri-apache
- nri-nginx
- nri-mysql

You have to add `newrelic-infra-integrations` as the first item of the
`nrinfragent_integrations` with the desired state `absent`.

```
nrinfragent_integrations:
  - { name: newrelic-infra-integrations, state: "absent" }
```

###### DEPRECATED

Specify the license key. For backward compatibility. Use `license_key` in
`nrinfragent_config` instead. If both are specified the one in
`nrinfragent_config` will be used.
